# Project 

I decided to to the same project using two design pattern models : MVC( Model View Controleurs ) , MVA ( Model View Adapter ) and Abstract Factory  . The reason behind my choice is that I worked with MVC before and found it very comforting ,so by creating the same project in three different methods I will be able to see and comprehend the big difference between them.

Project : Shoe customization store , the user can choose the shoe he wants either nike or adidas , and decide the theme that can be designed on them : manga , anime , soccer, basketball or food .
